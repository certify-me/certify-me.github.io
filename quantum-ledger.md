HeroTitle: Quantum-Secure Ledger for Top-Level Safety of Digital Certificates
HeroText: Issue quantum ledger ID-integrated digital credentials to protect cryptographic algorithms used in digital credentials.

BoxContentTitle: What is a quantum ledger?
BoxContentText: Quantum Ledger (QLDB) is an open-source, decentralized ledger database that stores every detail without the flexibility of removing or deleting an entry or modifying the history. It also refers to a ledger or data structure designed to harness the power of quantum computing. <br> Quantum computers can perform complex computations and solve certain problems much faster than classical computers, which opens up possibilities for new types of data storage and management systems.

Feature1Title: Quantum Ledger Has Become The New Standard for Data Integration in Digital Credentials
Feature1Text: Quantum Ledger provides a state-of-the-art data security mechanism that simplifies complex record maintenance. It’s an ideal application for digital credentials as the ledger database retains the footprint of a digital certificate.<br> QLDB has no single point of failure because it runs on many nodes in parallel, which can be located anywhere in the world. It is also highly scalable as more nodes are added without any downside since Quantum Ledger becomes more fault tolerant and more reliable with the number of nodes available. <br> Quantum ledger-integrated digital credentials are future-proof against the potential threat of quantum computers. No matter how advanced quantum computing gets, the security and privacy of digital credentials remain intact.
