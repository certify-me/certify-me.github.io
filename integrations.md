1FeaturesMessage: Take advantage of CertifyMe's Learning Management System (LMS) Plugins to issue credentials. The integration of an LMS into a company's existing infrastructure comes with several benefits. By using the LMS plugins, users can instantly receive, retrieve and update their credentials. In addition, the LMS can be used to track progress and the completion of training requirements. Using LMS Plugins institutions can issue credentials without depending on a third-party application.
