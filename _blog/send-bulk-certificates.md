After logging in, you will typically find an option to create a new certificate template. Click on it to begin designing your certificate.

1. Choose a template style that suits your needs or create a custom design from scratch.

1. Customize the template by adding your organization's logo, colors, and any other design elements you prefer.

1. Ensure that there is enough space for variable fields (attributes) that you want to include on the certificates.


### Step 3: Add Attributes to the Design

Now, it's time to add the variable fields (attributes) to your certificate. These fields can include the recipient's name, course name, date of completion, and any other relevant information. In CertifyMe, there should be an option to add these attributes to the design. Drag and drop or click on the desired location on the certificate template to insert the attribute placeholders.


### Step 4: Save Your Certificate Template

Once you have designed your certificate and added all the necessary attributes, save the template. Give it a meaningful name for easy reference in the future.

### Step 5: Award Certificates Using CSV

1. To send multiple certificates in a single click, you can use a CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file.

1. Prepare a CSV file containing the recipient's information, with each row representing a different recipient and each column corresponding to the attributes you've added (e.g., Name, Course Name, Date of Completion).

1. In CertifyMe, there should be an option to upload this CSV file.

1. Map the columns in your CSV to the corresponding attributes on your certificate template.

1. Once the mapping is complete, initiate the certificate generation process. CertifyMe will automatically populate the certificate template with the data from your CSV file and generate individual certificates for each recipient.

### Step 6: Award Certificates Using API (Optional)

If you have a larger volume of certificates to send, consider using the API provided by CertifyMe to automate the process.
Consult CertifyMe's API documentation for detailed instructions on how to use their API to send certificates in bulk.

## Conclusion
Sending multiple certificates in a single click is a breeze with CertifyMe certificate generator. By following these simple steps, you can design and send customized certificates efficiently, whether you choose to use CSV or the API. This feature is particularly useful for organizations that regularly issue certificates for courses, events, or achievements.
