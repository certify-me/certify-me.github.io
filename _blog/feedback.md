When was the last time you received positive feedback for a job well done? How did it make you feel?
You do not need to be an expert in human psychology to know that people respond well to sincere appreciation. It is an emotion we have all experienced. We feel elevated when someone takes the time to thank us for our work.
That’s why the most influential leaders make a habit of delivering positive feedback. They know that it’s an integral part of elevating the performance of their team members.
