# Macro Impact of Micro Credentials

Employees, students, learners and members of the organization love to get recognised through digital badges. The most important factor that has led the digital credentials movement to gain popularity is the organizationsâ€™ ability to recognise their users.

Employees, students and members these days are learner-centred and wish to participate in education programs that give them something in return. In other words, users want to support and participate in programs that influence their knowledge and encourage inspiration.


Educational universities, Government Agencies and non-profit organizations have now started issuing and identifying digital credentials which recognise the competency of the learner or members skills and talents. For example, American Occupational Therapy Association (AOTA) offers a digital badge program that recognises and encourages the learning achievements of its users and members.

Higher Education and Universities have now started to issue micro-credentials also called mini qualifications or nano qualifications to document their achievements, progress and participation. Digital Badges and micro-credentials could be issued by any university, agency or organization irrespective of their industry types and size of the industry. 

During the recent global pandemic, where educational institutions and employees were forced to go remote, micro-credentials and digital badges have helped impact colleges, universities, and industries to issue digital badges that recognises their talent and encourage the employment rate.

The most crucial factor about these micro-credentials is their diversity and inclusion, space for mental health, accessibility, verifiability and shareability.
