# Get better at Digital Certificate  

The past few decades have shown a drastic change in the working and running of the educational institutionsâ€™ process. New technology and new tools are ongoing in this present digital world. And the recent global pandemic has introduced traditional on-site classrooms to the new online classroom platforms.

Online classrooms help students learn in a virtual classroom through digital platforms. Online learning or e-learning in the early 90s was mostly used for higher education, but as of 2022, it is accessed by students of all age-groups globally.

The recent global pandemic has forced many educational institutions to go online, while it seemed difficult to adjust for some, it gained popularity soon with all the benefits that it comes with. Initially, there were a lot of questions regarding online education platforms, mostly questioning the legitimacy of training and the validity of credentials to be received.

In a world where certifications can be faked or manipulated, digital education platforms must take the aid of digital credentials platforms that are backed with robust blockchain technology.

A digital certificate is a digital equivalent to a paper-based certification. It can be encrypted with bank-level security that dismisses the chances of the certification getting manipulated or tampered with. The digital certificate includes the name of the issuer, the recipient, a digital signature that verifies the authenticity of the contents of the certificate acquired.

Although a digital certificate helps verify the legitimacy of the education provider, it is acquired post completion of the entire course. Hence, an online education provider must grab the attention of the learner throughout the course. A few steps can help do so:

The learning process: The learner differs from person-to-person making the learning process subjective and sometimes complex. The education provider needs to simplify the process of learning that encourages engagement.


The legitimacy of the course: Oftentimes, learners may doubt the legitimacy of the online program. Therefore, the education providers must treat the learning program just like the traditional classrooms. This will increase attentiveness and gain the trust of the learners. 

Continuity: The learning process needs to be disciplined and continuous. An online education platform that is not consistent with their work and progress encourages the student to participate and engage more.

Feedback: Allow learners to provide genuine feedback regarding the program. This could help the education provider improvise and get better.

Referrals: Enable a referral program for learners who have finished their program, this will attract new learners and create a brand value for the learning program.

### In Conclusion: 

Digital certifications are the future of online education programs and are increasingly gaining popularity among new learners. Digital certificates are issued by a digital credential platform that is backed with robust blockchain technology that comes with high security and is traceable and verifiable.
