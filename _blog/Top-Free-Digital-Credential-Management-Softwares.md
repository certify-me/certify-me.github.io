# Top Free Digital Credential Management Softwares


Businesses can use Digital Credentials Management software to transition from physical credential and badge management to digital credentials. This has several advantages, including improved visibility, increased efficiency, and increased accessibility, particularly for networked or remote teams.

Digital credential management software aims to simplify and secure the management of digital credentials, certificates, and badges for HR personnel, managers, and team members. Rather than just printing and mailing certificates, credentialing solutions allow users to create, share, and store all credentials digitally.

A product must meet the following criteria to be considered for inclusion in the Digital Credential Management category:

Automate the process of designing and producing digital credentials, certificates, and badges
Control the distribution, sharing and storage of digital credentials, certificates, and badges
Provide corporate LMS integrations to make tracking digital credential requirements easier
