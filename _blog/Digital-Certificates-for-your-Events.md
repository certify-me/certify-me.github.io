# Digital Certificates for your Events
Organising an event requires a lot of effort and time to invest. A successful event becomes memorable creating brand awareness and increasing the traffic towards the program. But the question remains, how do we make an event successful or memorable?

### Giveaway rewards:

Digital events or events that take place virtually on digital platforms need engagement. To do so the vent organiser could issue or giveaway rewards to the participants for a long-lasting impression of the event. These rewards could be digitised in form of encrypted digital certificates and digital badges, which the participants could share and display on their social media platforms and use for career development.

### Brand Awareness:

Digital certificates and Digital badges rewarded in a digital event acts as a memoir for the participant to display on their digital platform. When these digital credentials are displayed on social media or social networking sites it will create a buzz and curiosity among other members creating brand awareness and gaining new members to participate in the events. This is also one of the most effective ways to gain organic traffic.

### Additional Events:

With help of analytical tools, calculate the performance and engagement of the previous events and create additional events to target the engaged members. This will make the members invested in the program and the rewards will help attract multiple other members within their social circle. Analytical tools also provide accurate outcomes of the engagement and performance which will help the even organisation to work and improve on.

## In Conclusion:

Digitised events need to recognise their participant with Digital certificates and Digital badges for them to hold as a memoir and display them within their social circle.
