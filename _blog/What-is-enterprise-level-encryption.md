# What is enterprise level encryption?


Considering the fact that businesses collect a considerable amount of sensitive user data to provide services, it is reasonable to assume data security and privacy must be one of their top objectives. 

Since data breaches, data manipulation, and cyber threats continue to expand and advance with the introduction of new technologies and programs, a large amount of data may be at risk, including:

Documents containing personal information
Details of your credit card or enterprise account
Numbers and passcodes for security

Data security and privacy are two key components of establishing trust between a firm and its customers. Privacy is determined by which data is protected, how it is protected, from whom it is protected, and who is responsible for that protection. Data security is to prevent unauthorised access to data through breaches or leaks, regardless of who the unauthorised party is.

## What is Enterprise-Level encryption?

Simply put, Protecting businesses like enterprises do is enterprise-level security. So, how exactly does a enterprise protects its systems? 

Firewall software is used by financial institutions as the first line of defence against cyber attackers. Furthermore, financial institutions encrypt all of your digital files and transactions, making it difficult for cyber hackers to access your information.

256-bit AES, or advanced encryption standard, is the industry standard for enterprise-level encryption but AES-128 is commonly associated with enterprise-level encryption. It employs a symmetric-key algorithm, which means it employs the same key for both encryption and decryption.

The data is encrypted in 128-bit blocks, and the key can be one of three sizes: 128-, 192-, or 256-bits. To protect your data from being intercepted by third parties, most professional-grade security systems employ an encryption standard.
