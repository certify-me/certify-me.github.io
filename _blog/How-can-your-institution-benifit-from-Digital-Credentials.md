# How can your institution benifit from Digital Credentials

Any institution can improve its performance and engagement with constant development staying updated about new tools and technologies. With the recent global pandemic and its return bringing in digital transformation, institutions must enhance their digital skills and adapt to new digital technologies.

The digital transformation has brought in many drastic changes across the world and industries. One of the many changes that digitalisation got into the light is the use and issue of Digital credentials replacing the traditional paper-based certificates.

Digital credentials prove to be more effective and benefit the institution better and Hereâ€™s why and how:

### Cost-effective:

Paper-based certifications came with a lot of expenses including the cost of materials, labour, production and issuing costs. With materials being a limiting factor of production and the production waste contributing to environmental degradation, institutions had to cost more than what was bargained for. 

Digital credentials being virtual credentials cuts the cost of material and labour. Digital credential platforms issue credentials at a reasonable price and can be edited and customised. This saves the productivity of labour and costs that goes into producing, issuing and delivering the credential.

### Promotion:

Learners need their education, achievement and efforts to be recognised to advance further in careers. Digital credentials as compared to traditional paper-based credentials is verifiable, shareable, and traceable. These credentials come with bank-level security and are enabled with encryption and a digital key.

This helps institutions promote the legitimacy of the credential to be issued to their learners valuing their progress in the programs and providing them with due recognition. 

### Secure:

Paper-based certifications are to be handled and stored physically, increasing the chances of the certification getting lost, stolen or manipulated. With help of a digital credential platform that is backed with blockchain technology, it becomes easier for institutions to issue a secure credential with a digital key and digital signature. Digital key and encryption save the credential from any data manipulation and cyber threats.

Apart from that, Digital Credentials can also be shared on all digital platforms and portfolios to display the competency of their skills and qualifications acquired and advance in their career. Both institutions and learners can benefit from digital credentials for their secure and verifiable factors.

## In Conclusion:

The utmost security that digital credentials come with allows institutions to gain and engage new learners into the programs benefiting the brand value and image. Digital credentials also help promote the legitimacy of the institution.
