# Six Popular and In-Demand Financial Certifications 2022


The World Economic Forum's "Future of Jobs Report", 2020, proposes prioritizing cloud technology, data science, and e-commerce in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Nearly 40% of employees are required to reskill for six months, with a staggering 94% of employers expecting their staff to master new skills and modern technology.

While the talent gap is projected to expand as in-demand skills transition, financial management and mitigating the risks that come with it are critical. Financial certifications demonstrate expertise in a certain sector of the financial industry. When looking for a financial consultant to employ, you'll notice that each financial practitioner's name is preceded by a series of initials. There are a variety of designations available, including CFA, FRM, CFP, and others. This acronym stands for a variety of financial certificates.

Obtaining a CPA license can help accountants increase their career opportunities, job security, and earning possibilities.

The American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) awards the designation of Certified Public Accountant (CPA) to those who have demonstrated competence in the field of accounting (AICPA).
