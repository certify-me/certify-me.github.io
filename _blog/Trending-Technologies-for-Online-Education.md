# Trending Technologies for Online Education

Technology has grown fast in recent years, resulting in a digital revolution. The top educational recent advancements in 2020 were data analysis, machine learning, as well as the Internet - Of - things (IoT). E-learning, on the other hand, has emerged as the dominant trend. The COVID-19 pandemic has profoundly altered the way we learn and practice.

They encourage learning that is focused on the student. Continuing interest and engagement are possible thanks to these top educational technology advances mentioned below:

## AR/VR Technology:

Since the introduction of virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) to education, the classroom learning experience has changed drastically. Users can immerse themselves in the conditions of an artificially manufactured reality using virtual reality. Learners can get a better picture of an object via augmented reality.

While VR creates a virtual experience, AR enhances the perspective of a real picture. As a result, they aid in the explanation of complicated topics that plain graphics or even lab-based hands-on activities could not.

## Gamified Learning:

The concept of personalization lies at the heart of gamified learning. Gamification is the technique of introducing game elements into learning. Structured and content gamification are the two basic types of gamification. Both are beneficial in their own ways. The unifying benefit of these two kinds would be that learners like playing games while concurrently learning new stuff. Gamification also allows them to practice their abilities and assess their performance.

While participating in interesting game activities, learners can understand and practice. Gamification is most commonly used in the Primary and secondary school education sector. It's because children become immediately engrossed in gaming tutorials or in achieving greater game scores. However, this does not negate the necessity for enjoyable components in higher education or business training to increase participation.

Artificial Intelligence (AI):

Because AI automates instructional procedures, it makes learning more enjoyable and less time-consuming. For teachers, AI functions as a personal assistant who takes on extra responsibilities. It takes away time that may be spent enjoying the genuine interaction among students.

Artificial intelligence is predicted to account for 47 percent of e-learning systems by 2024, as it becomes a more important aspect of personalization and specialization of individual-based learning.

## Blockchain:

The Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) from blockchain offers several advantages to education, particularly in terms of data storage. The storage capacity is potentially limitless since each additional piece of information or data adds a new "block" to the database.

According to Gartner, 2% of higher education universities and colleges began utilizing blockchain technologies in 2019, with another 18% planning to do so in the next two years. Blockchain technology is protected by bank-level encryption, which protects the system and its credentials while also making it easier to work with.

## eLearning:

Because of COVID-19's rapid expansion and school closures, distance learning quickly rose to prominence in 2020 educational trends in technology. As a result, the need for online education platforms is increasing. Several huge EdTech companies like edX, Coursera, MasterClass, and Udemy, as well as higher education behemoths like Harvard, Yale, and others, have embraced E-learning for a more personalized and enriched learning experience.

Many eLearning courses now contain animation, podcasts, and video, resulting in a multimodal and hands-on learning experience. As a result, you have a lot of options for creating instructional videos for students, professionals, or other learners. A strong eLearning platform can also be used in conjunction with a learning management system (LMS) to track your students' progress.
