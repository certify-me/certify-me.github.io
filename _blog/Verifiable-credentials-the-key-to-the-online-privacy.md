# Verifiable credentials the key to the online privacy


Physical verification using physical ID, pictures, and paper identification documents were the traditional methods of confirming the paperwork. Not to mention that the verification process often involved running errands from department to department and was, at most, time-consuming.

Digital verifiable credentials are the best possible solution to the rigorous verification process that is both tiring and time-consuming.

So, what exactly are these Verifiable Credentials?

Verifiable credentials, which were authorised by the W3C in 2019, are the digital equivalents of paper documents such as identification documents and educational records or more.

Verifiable credentials are the most secure way to issue and access the document and the records are stored in digital databases. They can be encrypted with a digital passcode to ensure the document is safe from any unauthorised access.

## Benefits of Verifiable Credentials and Online privacy:

## Secure:

Verified Credentials are the most secure way of issuing a digital credential. Blockchain technology is used in many digital credentialing systems, which simplifies the issuance process while maintaining bank-level security. Verified Credentials can be encrypted with a digital password or key to keep the document safe from unauthorised or third-party access. 

## Verified:

The name of the issuer, receiver, and certificate criteria, as well as the issue date and expiration date, are all stored in digital databases or digital data with Verified Credentials. These databases assist in tracking the credential's issuance as well as verifying the document's integrity.

## Shareable:

Verified Credentials can be shared in a variety of ways. When a person receives a digital certificate, they are sent to a sharing page where they can share it on social media sites like Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram, as well as LinkedIn and by mail. A URL or link is also included in Verified Credentials, which can be included in portfolios or resumes.

## Control:

Individuals have complete control over what and how much information they share, putting an end to data collection overload. Only the data points, or qualities, that we want to communicate can be displayed. We don't have to divulge our every personal detail, record or data, this selective sharing and control over who has the access to the document is called selective disclosure.

## Data security:

People are more aware than ever in regards to their data security and privacy. Only the user may decide how and with whom data is shared when they have verifiable credentials. Unlike today's process of identification models, an organisation cannot access this data without the individual's expressed consent. There are no intermediaries, third-party access or accepting cookies since the user themselves choose and control the data sharing and data privacy.

In Conclusion: 

Because technology is rapidly advancing and every area of traditional working activities is becoming digital, people must become familiar with verified credentials that are secure and allow complete control and access to data privacy and security.
