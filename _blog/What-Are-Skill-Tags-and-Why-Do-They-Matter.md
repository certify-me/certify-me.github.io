# What Are Skill Tags and Why Do They Matter


We've all heard of the digital badge's anatomy, right? Badge title, badge description, date of issue, the identity of issuer and recipient, and expiration date But, apart from that, how do we simplify the context of the badges on display and assist recruiters in distinguishing between them?

Skill Tags are a feature that allows you to mark useful skills that aren't necessarily related to your work function. The competencies earned through a certification or training programme are defined by skill tags applied to digital badges. For instance, for their digital badge in Advanced Excel, Sam's skill tags include Power Query, Advanced charting, Conditional formatting.

Because education and training programmes emphasise skill-based performance above course completion, skill tags are critical for providing context and demonstrating the value of the certification and training programme.

## Skill Tags feature : Their Importance and Need

The skill-gap crisis caused by the global pandemic and the persistent changes it has induced in business activities must be addressed by conducting training and educational programmes, courses that issue digital credentials such as digital badges and digital certifications that prove the legitimacy of the skills acquired.

The exposure or accessibility of digital badges obtained through certification programmes, courses, or training boosts when users exhibit them on public digital platforms or through extensions in search engines. While digital badges aid in visibility, skill tags aid in defining the context or relevance of such badges.

To sum it up, skill tags are critical in providing contextual information about your competencies to the recruiters or hiring managers in regards to the digital badge.

## What to add and How to add:

Skill tags can be placed on your professional profile or portfolio, and there are no limits on how many you can have. Skill tags could also be tailored to the job title or description's relevancy. One can boost their visibility and relevance for employment by researching skill tags using keyword research tools available on the internet and strategic planning.

On professional websites like LinkedIn users can list their skills under ‘Skills’ which is then displayed for the profile visitors and recruiters. Skill tags could be added to your portfolios and resume describing your capabilities and talents. To provide context for their skills and capabilities, one can add as many skill tags as they like.

To identify the talents recipients have to demonstrate or learn to receive their credentials, skill tags are added to the credential specifications.

### In Conclusion:

To boost exposure and awareness for third-party recruiters and prospective employers, skill tags could be included to describe the digital badge obtained through training or course programmes. The abilities entered could also be used to generate real-time job exposure and to understand how skill tags affect career prospects.
