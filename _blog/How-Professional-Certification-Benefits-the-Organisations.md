# How Professional Certification Benefits the Organisations?


The global pandemic has brought about some significant changes that organisations must adapt to remain relevant. One of the key challenges that businesses confront as they move forward with digitisation is the skill-gap crisis. The necessity for reskilling is recognised by both employers and employees.

Many organisations have begun to use professional certification courses and training to enhance and reskill their staff with updated information to address the issue of workforce reskilling. Furthermore, many professional certification programmes include a digital certificate that serves as an official confirmation of the employee's training and abilities.

Hereâ€™s how organisations can benefit from professional certification:

## Reskilling:

The current technological transition has raised an important dilemma regarding what to do when workers begin to lack the abilities required for their jobs: do we lay off entire workforces or retrain them? According to the Future of Jobs Report 2020, 43% of businesses surveyed aim to downsize their employment as a result of technology integration, while 34% plan to expand their workforce as a result of technology integration.

Retraining personnel with new learning skills in the areas of technology integration and digitalisation is critical in both circumstances. Professional certification programmes will aid in the resolution of this problem by providing employees with training new skills and competencies. Because these programmes give digital credentials, they serve as verifiable evidence of gained skills and training.

## Career Advancement:

Employees will almost certainly benefit from professional certification programmes that give digital credentials. Because these digital credentials are portable, shareable, and easy to view, they allow employees to display them on their digital platforms and integrate them in their portfolios, enhancing their brand value and increasing options for networking and employment.

## Employee Satisfaction:

Education and training or reskilling employees with new learning skills through professional certification programmes does not result in a reduction in the workforce; rather, it focuses on strengthening the skills and capacities of the workforce, resulting in employee satisfaction. Employee satisfaction will also aid in lowering turnover rates.

## Boosts Productivity:

Professional certifications allow certified individuals to grasp the value of conforming to specified professional standards during their training. Employee satisfaction is increased when companies focus on training their employees and invest in their professional development. As a result, employees are more willing to help and contribute as a result of the skills they have learned. 

#### In Conclusion:

In light of the present worldwide pandemic situation and advancing technologies, professional certification programmes are becoming increasingly important for businesses. Organizations might benefit from professional certification programmes in terms of reskilling, professional growth, employee satisfaction, and higher productivity.
