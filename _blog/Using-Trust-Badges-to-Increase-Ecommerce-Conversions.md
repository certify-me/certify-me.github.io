# Using Trust Badges to Increase Ecommerce Conversions


It's aggravating to effectively take a customer through the sales funnel and develop offers that pique their interest, only to lose them at the point of purchase. Cart abandonment is becoming a serious problem that e-commerce businesses can no longer ignore.

According to Statista, roughly 15% of cart abandonment occurs due to customer concerns about security, while another study claims that E-Commerce firms lose $18 billion in sales income each year due to cart abandonment. We may deduce from this case that buyer reassurance is essential for conversions and revenue generation.

Trust badges are a simple emblem that reassures customers that they're on the correct track and instills confidence in them.

## What is a Trust Badge, and how does it work?

It's exactly what the name implies much like a trust badge. It's a trust-instilling badge that you display on your website. They're most commonly found during the checkout page. Traditionally, trust badges were only accessible during the checkout process, but a new trend is gaining traction: displaying them on the home page. They're basic tools that can help your site's revenues, traffic, and customer satisfaction.

When third-party enterprises decide to let your company use their seal, they are assuring prospective consumers that your company is legitimate and that their information is safeguarded. 

## Types of Trust Badges:

## Secure Checkout Badge:

A Secure Socket Layer Badge Certification, often known as an SSL certificate, is the essential trust badge you should be using. It is undoubtedly the most crucial sort of trust badge. When you join up with companies that offer an SSL certificate, you'll be granted a secure checkout badge.

This type of trust badge shows that your site's checkout procedure is secure and protected, that data is encrypted, and that your customers' personal information or debit or credit card details would not be compromised.

Shopify is among the most well-known SSL providers. If you use Shopify to create an eCommerce store, you'll get integrated SSL certificates right away.


## Payment Trust Badges:

Nothing builds confidence like seeing a name you're familiar with. That is precisely how these trust badges are designed to accomplish. Having the Visa, Mastercard, Amex or PayPal badges mentioned as accepted payment alternatives might help your website get credibility without you trying to deliver a lot of effort.

Because "more familiarity also means a higher feeling of security," placing these trademarks in the footer instills a sense of security and assurance among customers.

Free Shipping and Returns Trust Badge:

Customers abandon their carts for a variety of reasons, one of which is their return and shipment policies. Customers are concerned about whether they will be able to return items quickly in the event of damage or other issues, or if they will be able to receive free shipping. Customers want to know that returns, exchanges, and shipping are all free and secure. 

Trust badges such as the "Money-Back Guarantee," "Free Shipping," "Free Returns," or "Easy Returns" can create trust and a sense of security in your customers, eliminating most of the potential concerns of shopping online.

## Third-Party Endorsements:

Because these programs communicate to individuals that you are an established brand, these trust badges are all about demonstrating that your firm is legitimate. Prior to getting issued the badge, most of these trust badges need an approval process and an evaluation of your website.

The Better Business Bureau Accredited Business badge, the Google Trusted Store label, and the Amazon Best Seller Credibility Badge, for example, all lend substantial levels of confidence to your site. A third-party endorsement seal "usually implies corporate credibility," as the Baymard Institute correctly indicated. That's all there is to it.

## Money-Back Guarantee Badges:

This website badge is completely free and yet still serves to strengthen online customers â€™ confidence. You can make your own badges, however, if you don't have that type of graphic design talent, you can readily obtain downloadable variants of this badge.
