No matter what business you are in, marketing goes hand in hand in generating awareness and sales. Digital credentials being a visual artifact that can be organically shared across social media can drastically help improve your existing branding marketing initiatives.

On average, a single digital credential attracts around 3500 + views when shared across just one medium like LinkedIn. So if you had missed issuing a digital certificate/badge for your last training program, conference or webinar, you might have missed out on a massive opportunity for free advertising.

Digital credentials are a great way to market your next training, engage employees, attract new members to an association, or even recruit new delegates to your next event.
