### Step 3: Two-Step Diploma Creation Process

CertifyMe simplifies the diploma creation process into two easy-to-follow steps.

1. <b>Step 3.1: Information – Basic Details and Expiration Date</b><br>
In the first step, you'll need to provide the basic information for the diploma. This includes:
    
    1. Title: Enter the diploma title, such as "Certificate of Completion" or "Diploma in [Course Name]."
    
    1. Recipient's Name: Input the student's name who will be receiving the diploma.
    
    1. Date of Completion: Specify the date when the student completed the course or program.
    
    1. Expiration Date (Optional): If applicable, set an expiration date for the diploma. This is useful for certificates that require periodic renewal.
    
    1. Once you've filled in the necessary information, proceed to the next step.


1. <b>Step 3.2: Diploma Design – Customization and QR Code</b><br>
Now, it's time to design your diploma. CertifyMe offers a range of elegant designs to choose from, ensuring your digital diploma looks professional and appealing. Follow these sub-steps to complete the design:
    
    1. Select Design: Browse through the available diploma designs and pick the one that suits your needs.
    
    1. Custom Variables: CertifyMe allows you to include unlimited custom variables, such as the institution's name, logo, and additional course-specific information. Customize the diploma to make it unique.
    
    1. Verifiable QR Code: CertifyMe provides the option to add a verifiable QR code to the diploma. This QR code can be scanned to instantly verify the authenticity of the certificate.
    
    1. Once you've finished designing your diploma, click "Save" or "Finish" to proceed.
