# How to Attract and Engage Millennial Members

The membership program could vary from generation to generation. A certain program could attract young learners while the other may be suitable for the older generation. In both cases, it is advisable to study the generation and understand their mannerisms and understanding.

Each generation is defined by a term as follows:

People born in the era 1955 to 1965 are referred to as Boomers
People born in the era 1965 to 1980 are referred to as Gen X
People born in the era 1981 to 1996 are referred to as Millennials
People born in the era 1997 to 2012 are referred to as Gen Z

Research suggests that Millennials hold the most buying power. Considering the age group of millennials which is presently 25-40, is the most appropriate age group to target for a membership program. This is because the millennial generations are adults and most career-oriented, having an understanding of how things work in the corporate world.

## The Millennial Mindset:

The Millennial generation ranging from the age group 25-40 (present) are the generation that grew with the internet era. This was the generation that, although born during the rise of the internet and digital world, grew and adapted to the digital changes before Generation Z and the further generations.

Every millennial is associated with the working of the digital platform, digital media and digital tools. Therefore, it is not a big task for the organization to make these generations understand how digital platforms work.

To attract and engage a millennial in a membership program one might want to consider the below mentioned things:

Although being a whole set of generations from the same era, values and culture differ from person to person. What one finds beneficial, others may not.
It is crucial to make them understand the working of the organization and the benefits that come with participating in the membership program
Focus on educational aspects, quality aspects, performance aspects of the program that may attract a millennial

## Promise Growth and Improvement:

Millennials are career-focused and wish to support, contribute and participate in organizations that may further benefit their career. Hence, an organization needs to have its own set of values that may set a belief or trust among its members. 

Unlike the boomer generation and the generation before who were focused on a single job with a single qualification, Millennials are driven by a learning force. They want to quantify their skills and qualifications to increase their chances of employment. Hence, a promise of growth and improvement in the membership program would effectively attract a millennial to join.

Apart from these, organizations may offer short-term membership programs, feedback for improvisation and referral programs to increase engagement.

## In Conclusion:

Millennials are the most career-driven and focused generation in the present world, with an open-minded approach towards new organizations that add value to their qualification. If the organization strategies its program and markets it effectively, millennials are easy to attract and engage.
