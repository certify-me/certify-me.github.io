That person then proceeds to post it on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or some other social media channels. As the post draws traction and gains visitors, the brand gains visibility on each platform. The display of credentials will also create a sense of curiosity among people. Thus, it leads to brand awareness.<br>

<h6>Website Traffic</h6>
One of the major factors of digital credentials is their portability and shareability. When a person shares their credentials by embedding them on the profile or via links, they get directed to the organization page, driving traffic towards the site and creating brand visibility and awareness.<br>
