# Digital Certificates for Educational Universities
Blockchain Digital Credentials have changed the face of the education sector globally. With the recent global pandemic where people had to be quarantined in their houses, the need for digital educational platforms and advancements of technologies has risen. 

EdTech companies like Udemy, Coursera and Upgrad have already implemented blockchain technology for the advancements of education platforms and better learning programs. Digitalising educational universities by leveraging the power of technology and advanced tools are the need of the hour. Issuing Digital Credentials through a blockchain technology credential platform acts as the first step towards the digital transformation of the university.

Digital Credentials are Secure from Fraudulent Practices:

We are all aware of the existence and issue of fake credentials under the name of any university for unlawful practices. Blockchain technology is enabled with advanced and robust security that refuses any third party access from scam-sters to the original document.

Blockchain technology is integrated with advanced and secure databases and digital ledgers that record and store the credential issued under their platform. This helps educational universities as well as professionals to verify the legitimacy of the credential issued and are safe from any fraudulent practices.

Digital credentials that are backed with blockchain technology are also enabled with encryption and a digital key that secures the contents of the credentials from getting manipulated, forged or hacked.

### Automation:

While the traditional paper-based credentials required a lot of time and effort to produce and issue the credential to the recipient, it took at least a month for the whole process to be done and required a lot of manual work and labour.

This manual work can be avoided by integrating automation. Automation uses technology to replace physical human tasks and input. By inputting the criteria, process and action into the automation software one can let the software do the whole work. With Automation, Digital certificates can be issued in seconds or mere minutes.

### Brand Awareness:

Learners or participants who are recognised or rewarded with Digital credentials love to display their credentials within their social circle, social media or social networking sites. This act makes them social ambassadors creating brand awareness as the display of credentials creates curiosity among people and encourages them to get to know more about the credentials and the issuing university.

## In Conclusion:

Digital transformation of the education sector will help learners progress better and provide a progressive learning platform. EdTech companies have already implemented Digital credentials into their educational programs and have seen potential growth and participation among learners. Sooner or later, Digital credentials will replace paper-based credentials and the education sector must adapt to the need for digital certification.
