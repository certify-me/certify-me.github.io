# What is a Digital Open Badge?

Digital Open Badges are gaining popularity among businesses for their verifiability, shareability and security.

## What is a Digital Open Badge?

A traditional physical badge demonstrates a person's ability, talent, or interest. Digital Open Badges function similarly to physical badges and are an online equivalent to them. Digital badges, whether through gamification or graphics, aid in the display of progress and achievement in a specific skill.

The image or graphics of the digital open badge include meta-data that stores information such as the issuer's name, the recipient's name, the issue date, the expiration date, the digital signature, the URL or links, and the badge's criteria. The authority can also revoke digital badges in the event of misuse; although the revocation is not displayed on the badge itself, it is stored in the meta-data.

Because of the more detailed information about any certification with the Open Badges system, the badges improve and enable verification of potential candidates' credentials. This also allows recruiters and employers to get a better understanding and context for any certifications an individual has, making the decision-making process more thorough.

## Digital Badges for Issuers:

### Digital badges help the issuer in the following:

Converting lengthy courses into sections or modules for easier comprehension and progression
Gamifying the learning programme through the use of digital badges, micro-credentials, or stacked credentials
Aids in recognising the candidate based on their proficiency in the acquired skill
Increases engagement while also raising brand awareness

### Why Choose Between a Badge and a Certificate?

At Certifyme.online, businesses or issuers are free to choose between issues of digital certifications or digital badges. They are not obliged with any restrictions and have a choice to create, issue their own set of credentials.

Digital certificates are valuable credentials that can be used to recognise educational qualifications, degrees or diplomas, participation, or identification documents.

Digital Badges are minimal credentials that are still in the early stages of development. They can be given out to recognise progress, skill, interest, or talent.

Issuers can personalise their credentials by specifying a name, accreditation, digital logo and signature, and technical specifications. These credentials can also be shared and verified.

To sum it up, Digital Badges and Digital Certificates are a safe, simple, and effective way to recognise an individual's educational qualification, skill, interest, talent, and participation. They are supported by metadata that verifies the identity and contents of the issued credential, and they are also protected by bank-level security that prevents unauthorised access to the digital credential acquired.
