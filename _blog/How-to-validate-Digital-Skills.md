# How to validate Digital Skills?

The global pandemic was one of the most unpredictable things that have happened to the economy worldwide. People were forced to be quarantined at their homes and businesses had to completely go remote online. While businesses were forced to undergo digital transformation, no one predicted the permanency of going digital and adapting to the digital transformation.

This has made both the employers and employees learn new skills, invest in different automated software and cloud computing. This had to be done to stay relevant with the changes the world was going through regarding digital transformation.

Employees had to learn new skills and technologies and had to keep an update of the latest trends and software for the betterment of their performance. Every employee be it the Manager, HR, Salesperson, Associates had to learn to work online and compensate their skills through digital tools.

For the work to be done successfully, businesses needed to provide training and assistance to their employees to help them groom their skills and adapt to the new working conditions of the business. A thorough training that provides the employees with a digital credential that verifies their competency in the skills will increase their performance rate and encourage engagement.

Three trends that are here to stay and needs to be validated as per the McKinsey Reports are mentioned below:

### Distance economy:

While everyone was forced to work remotely in the year 2020 with the rise of covid, there has still been no end to the remote working pattern even in the year 2022. The rise of Covid still being relevant and the new variants that have come into force have made the remote work the new constant hence, adapting to the new and relevant digital skills and tools is a necessity.

### Imbalanced Supply and Demand:

Work going remote and people being quarantined at home has changed the spending habits of the people. People have to shop for their essentials online and order food through online platforms creating an imbalance in the supply and demand of the physical stores. This makes it crucial for these industries to adapt to eCommerce.

### Supply Chains:

International or even inter-state exchange of supplies has come to halt during the global pandemic affecting the supply chains. There has been a lot of encouragement to support local shops and suppliers giving them the attention that was earlier shadowed by the big manufacturing companies.

## In Conclusion:
With all the new trends and the rapid changes in digital tools and technologies, businesses must upskill their digital knowledge and groom their competency with the new tools and technologies. It is also essential to have their emotional and mental capabilities and health to be kept in check not giving in to the changing working conditions.
