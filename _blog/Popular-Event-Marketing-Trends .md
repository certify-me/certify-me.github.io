# Popular-Event-Marketing-Trends 


With the recent COVID-19 outbreak, and the persistent changes it has brought to the working of business activities, remote working has become the new norm. Apart from these, it has also revolutionized events popularizing virtual events or online events, live sessions and interacting with people through virtual platforms.

According to the Grand View Research Report, the worldwide virtual events market was worth $77.98 billion in 2019 and is predicted to increase at a CAGR of 23.2 percent from 2020 to 2027.

Let's take a look at some of the most popular event marketing trends for 2022:

## Interactive Video:

In-person events allowed people to interact, communicate and express themselves more effectively. While people miss that spark in virtual events, event marketers have started to implement interactive videos. Static overlays (graphics, text, and backlinks), applications (allowing user response in text, audio, or video format), quiz or poll questions, animations, and even picture-in-picture video or audio snippets are all examples of events that might happen within the video.

Augmented Reality/Virtual Reality:

AR and VR, or augmented and virtual reality, respectively, are realistic technologies that either augment or substitute a real-world experience with a simulated one. Adding a sense of realism to games, movies, and other media by augmenting the real world with computer-produced visuals is a terrific method to do it! Through the use of technology and sensory equipment such as headsets and gloves, virtual reality (VR) aids in the construction of realistic simulations and the "believability" of the spectator.

The Augmented World ExpoTM (AWE) is the world's largest convention and expo for professionals interested in making the world more interactive, with technological advances such as Augmented Reality, Wearable Computing, Smart Glasses, Gesture and Sensor systems, and The Wireless sensor Networks on display.

## Artificial Intelligence:

Businesses that use artificial intelligence to power customer engagement are expected to be one of the key drivers behind this remarkable artificial intelligence advancement. Companies are increasingly relying on AI to provide more personalized services to their customers. With a growing focus on customer service, the use of AI to interact with customers will only thrive.

In 2015, only 10% of organizations reported that they were already using artificial intelligence technology or planned to do so shortly. In 2019, that figure had risen to 37%, indicating that more than one-third of organizations are either using or planning to use artificial intelligence (Gartner, 2019).

AI could help event management and marketers save manual work when it comes to ticket sales, managing the event participants, automating the responses, and providing follow-ups post-event.
