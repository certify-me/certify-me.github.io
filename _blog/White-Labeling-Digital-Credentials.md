# White Labeling Digital Credentials

White labelling is when one company removes their brand name and allows other companies to rebrand its name legally. In simpler words, renaming the end-product of the brand with the requested purchaser.

White labelling is practised across all industries for:

Being cost-effective
Customer loyalty
Providing Credibility
Saving resources and time

### How does White-labelling Work?

White-labelling is when the organization purchases services from a white label company that then rebrands these services and resells them under your organization's name. White-label companies produce, manufacture, brand and sell their services in the name of the purchaser.

White-label digital credentials work in a similar way, where the Digital credentials platform issues white-labelled digital badges and digital certificates in the name of the purchaser. 

For example, Consider X company as a digital credentials platform that provides white labelled software to Y company for the purpose of reselling. One resold by the X company, Y company will brand it in its own name, accreditation and signature. This Final rebranded software by the Y company is then provided to the end customer. 

These digital badges and digital certificates are customised, designed and manufactured as per the requirement of the purchasing company.
