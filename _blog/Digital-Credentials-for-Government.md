#   Digital Credentials for Government

Digital Credentials have been around for a few years now and has been used across various industries. Ever since the global pandemic, the need for digitalisation has risen in regards to remote working and virtual learning and has led to the popularity of Digital Credentials.

## Need for Digital Credentials for the Government:

Governments such as the United States, for example, use it for purposes other than industrial or commercial purposes. An updated White House credentialing policy seeks to use agency-issued identifiers such as Social Security numbers to secure digital transactions. Researchers have been investigating what digital credentials can do on the spectrum of region management and customer provision to its citizens. 

The government wants effective action to accelerate the processes of limiting location data, citizen identification documents, expenditure and budget records, security clearances, digital infrastructure, and information exchange between departments.

Apart from quickening the documentation process, the government wants verified and secure portals to issue, deliver, and allow citizens easy access to the documents. The government would provide residents with digital documents in the form of chips or QR codes that they could use on their digital devices. Citizens can issue re-usable credentials for identity and records through the portal, which can also be used as a functional ID for verification purposes.

## Digitising credentials for the Government:

As we all know, despite the incorporation of digital identification processes, many service providers will still opt for the traditional method of authenticating the identity in the form of physical ID, photographs, or a lengthy process and time to obtain verification approval.

On the other hand, A government-run digital identity verification system would standardise the market by requiring all other digital services to work with the country's system.

From conventional to digital, the following factors, as compiled by researchers, are essential for ensuring a smooth and effective shift:

Rather than focusing on large-scale success with digitalisation and modernisation, begin with small steps by digitising the local, and then progress to larger-scale goals. This will assist citizens in becoming more familiar with the digital process and verification
In the long run, strategic planning and a detailed approach to developing modular digital infrastructure can help adapt to the provision of the digital distribution system and maybe more beneficial
Automate and integrate traditional systems to digital identification process for quick results and verification
With everything going on with the digital incorporation, try and get feedback from the citizens and cater the results for further improvements and solutions for effective results
