# Need for Digital Crenditials for businesses and commercial purposes



The rise in digitalisation led to a digital transformation of all industries giving rise to competition from businesses to businesses and industry to industry irrespective of their size structure. With new technologies invented now and then, businesses must stay relevant and stand out from the crowd.

The rapid and advancing growth in digital tools and technologies have made businesses realise the need to adapt to digital transformation. Digital skills increase the efficiency, accuracy and performance of businesses and their employees. Digital transformation changes every aspect of the businesses day-to-day working activities and provides accurate analysis of the performance.

The need for digital skills has made it crucial for businesses to enable digital skills training programs for their employees to enhance their skills and knowledge about the latest digital skills, platforms and tools. Apart from enabling a training program for their employees, businesses also need to get this training recognised by issuing a Digital Certificate.

Digital skills training programs that issue a digital credential are getting popular among employees and are encouraged to enrol in the same to enhance and quantify their skills, as Digital Credentials help both the businesses and their employees to progress and create a positive brand value.

Digital Credentials which includes Digital certificates and Digital badges are the digital evidence of the employees’ competency in the skills achieved. A digital credential issued is secured with a digital key that denies any third party access or data manipulation to the original document issued. The Digital certificate comes with a digital signature of the authority issued, which verifies the legitimacy of the credential received.

These digital credentials are also inexpensive reducing the cost of production, labour, the material used and other expenses that go into the distribution of the certification and training like travel and accommodation. Thus, a digital credential is extremely cost-effective and saves both time and effort for businesses. 

As digital credential recognises the employees’ progress, performance and achievements, it is easy for businesses to advertise their training program. As the program will help the employee quantify their skills for career development.

Since Digital credentials are a virtual document issued to recognise the members’ achievements, they can only be shared on digital platforms diminishing the factor of the certification getting lost or stolen.

## In Conclusion:

Digital transformation has introduced businesses with a personalised training platform that issues digital credentials that recognises the employees’ achievements and enhance their skill for better career development. Digital certification gives their employees a better understanding of the business’ working and helps them perform and progress better to achieve the set target.
