# What is Digital Learning?

Digital learning is a method of teaching that benefits students, learners, and professionals all over the world. It employs a variety of technology-assisted learning methodologies. Deeply integrated, personalized learning, and other methodologies that rely on digital resources in some way or another are all included.

# The need for Digital Certificates:

With everything going remote or virtual, paper-based certifications are being replaced with digital credentials, which have proven to be more effective than ever in terms of easy sharing and verification of documents obtained, as well as proving competencies with skill, ability, or qualifications acquired.

The need for reskilling has led businesses to provide digital skills training programs for their staff to improve their abilities and get a better understanding of the latest digital skills, technologies, and solutions. Apart from that, businesses need to issue digital credentials like digital certificates and digital badges that act as evidence to prove the competencies acquired and demonstrate their skills for prospective future employees.

People are encouraged to enroll in digital skills training programs that issue a digital credential to strengthen and quantify their talents since Digital Credentials assist both organizations and their employees' progress and promote a strong brand value.

# Benefits of Digital Certificates:

Verified: Digital certificates are validated credentials whose contents are maintained in digital databases that record the certification's criteria and contents and make it traceable.
Shareable: Digital certificates are easy to share across all digital platforms including social and networking sites and via mail.
Traceable: With the advancement of technology, there has been a considerable increase in fraudulent practices such as counterfeiting and bogus certifications. Recruiters can use digital certificates to validate the content and source of a credential and qualify the best candidate for the position.
