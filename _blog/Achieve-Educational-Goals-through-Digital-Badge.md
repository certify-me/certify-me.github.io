# Achieve Educational Goals through Digital Badge

With the changing developments in the learning structure, tools and technologies, it is easier to carry out additional learning practices updating with the changes in the levels of education. Initially, post-completion of the course, diploma or qualification, learners were awarded a diploma or certificate to identify the learners’ competency in the particular subject matter. In addition to that, a new low-stake credential called Digital badges is emerging among new learners.

Digital Badges are verified digital proof of the individual accomplishment in a skill or talent. Digital badges are issued to display individual skills and are still in a developing stage. These digital badges are replacing the traditional physical badge.
