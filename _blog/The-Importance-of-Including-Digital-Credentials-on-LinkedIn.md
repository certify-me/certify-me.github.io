<h1>Why Should You Add Your Digital Certificates on LinkedIn?</h1>
LinkedIn is a social networking platform designed for professionals. The site allows registered users to create a professional presence and document the professional journey among people they are connected with.<br>
Professional network news feeds and a limited number of customizable modules are available on a LinkedIn member’s profile page, which highlights talents, career history, and education. As proof of authenticity, simply adding the credentials establishes you as an individual who has a great work ethic and is trustworthy.<br>
Reid Hoffman, a former Executive Vice President at PayPal, co-founded LinkedIn. The site, which debuted in May 2003, now has over 300 million members from 200 countries and 170 industries. Reid Hoffman estimates that 27% of LinkedIn subscribers are recruiters.<br>
Experts believe that the rich troves of semi-structured data that LinkedIn’s members freely give away – job titles, geography, industry information, skill sets – has played a vital role in the current popularity of LinkedIn. Excelling in the professional sphere is unlikely without an account on LinkedIn and engaging in meaningful discussions there.<br>
A recent article by <a href="https://kinsta.com/blog/linkedin-statistics/#:~:text=The%20other%20primary%20reason%20LinkedIn,of%20recruiters%20regularly%20use%20LinkedIn.">Kinsta</a> shows, nearly 58 million organizations are listed on LI whereas 77% of recruiters regularly use this platform to hire new talents. This crucial but unsurprising number reveals the impact of LinkedIn on the job market.<br><br>
Thus, keeping your ‘digital resume’ updated is the first step toward bagging your dream job.<br>
Showcasing the badges/credentials you have acquired to date on LinkedIn can help you land jobs 78% faster. When LinkedIn shareable certificates & badges are available at your fingertip, why not enjoy their benefits?<br><br>

<h2>The Importance of Including Digital Credentials on LinkedIn:</h2>
With over 58 million organizations registered on Linkedin, it’s one of the most sought-after ways to get leads. LinkedIn has over 300 million active monthly users worldwide and nearly 1 billion transactions take place every month. On the platform, there are 690 million professionals enrolled, with 60.1% in the 25-34 age range.<br>
Linkedin’s user base generates 9 billion content impressions and 280 billion feed views per year. As a result, it truly is essential for most businesses to raise brand awareness.<br><br>
LI sharing enables you to share the certificate as a post on LinkedIn that is visible to the connections. As many views/comments this post receives, your chance of landing a job increases. You can also share the credentials via LinkedIn messaging. If there is a particular employer of interest, you can directly send the certificate to the company's HR or participate in their referral program.
Employers often track the LinkedIn accounts of potential candidates and such posts or certifications drive them to get in touch with the awardees.<br>

<h2>Why Should I Share Verifiable Credentials on LinkedIn?</h2>
Employees should present their <a href="https://certifyme.online/blog/What-is-a-Digital-Credential.html">digital credentials</a> on LinkedIn to boost their brand value and stimulate professional networking. It can open new doors to employment or a new business opportunity that you have been waiting for so long. As LinkedIn is an open job market, a simple post view or engagement can come as a boon.<br>
LinkedIn sharing equally helps organizations/certificate issuers. Sharing the credentials among a network of people with similar talents, positions, work experiences, and interests also increases the brand visibility of the issuer. This increases the number of new sign-ups and interest in training, membership, and programs.<br>
The professional site is an excellent platform for building portfolios and resumes by including their qualifications, employment history, work experience, recognitions, publications, and, most importantly, displaying certificates and badges.<br>

<h2>Should an issuing organization encourage awardees to feature digital credentials?</h2>
Yes. Flaunting the <a href="https://certifyme.online/blog/Experiencing-Digital-Certificate-and-Digital-badge.html">certificates & badges</a> not only helps employees but also enhances the brand presence of businesses.<br>
Most credentialing platforms offer a white labeling feature that provides a rebranding experience to organizations. It provides complete control over the credentialing platform’s details and the freedom to edit them out from the certificate or replace them with business information. It eliminates the confusion of third-party involvement.<br>
The institute's name comes all over the certificate several times. It inadvertently works as a promotional method without investing extra in marketing or brand promotion.<br>
Though usually students or program participants share certificates without persistence, being mindful of how to influence the awardees to showcase their credentials online can help the organization.<br>
The best way to do this is frequently engaging with the feature posts of the awardees. It encourages more students to do the same or share their credentials on their LinkedIn pages. Keeping a clear call to action button in the certificate enables your organization to enjoy the best benefit of digital credentials. In the CTA section, add a ‘share on LinkedIn’ or ‘share among your professional network’ button for a quick and hassle-free sharing experience.<br>
Constant engagement with LinkedIn posts and ease of sharing readily influence certificate holders to share their certificates/badges. It not only improves the online engagement of awardees but of the issuing organization as well.<br>
New candidate sign-ups become effortless without massive investment in sales and marketing. The digital credentials act as the marketing platform for you.<br>
