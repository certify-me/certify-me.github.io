# White labelling Service

When an organisation buys services from a white label company, the white label company rebrands the services and resells them under your company's name. White-label enterprises create, manufacture, brand, and sell services under the buyer's name.

White labelling has the following advantages to it:

White-labelling is cost-effective since it reduces the service provider's production and maintenance costs
By delivering quantity and quality of product and service, it helps to expand the brand's growth
Aids in the recognition of your brand and the development of client trust
Brands can access the new emergent market more quickly by using white-labelling
Allows for new ideas and information on current digital development
