# Use of Digital Credentials for Membership Organizations

How to use digital credentials for the benefit of both the organization and its members is a crucial question. Another question being should we issue digital certificates or digital badges or both? If both are to be issued should we issue them separately or together?

## Digital credential consists of Digital Certificates and Digital Badges.

Digital certificates are the digital equivalent to paper-based certificates. They can be issued as a high-stake credential for obtaining a degree, completing a qualification or accomplishing a project. The anatomy of a digital certificate consists of the organization credentials, recipient name, qualified degree credentials, date of issue and digital signature of the respective authority.

Digital badges are low-stake credentials awarded for making a progress, obtaining a soft skill and hard skill, loyalty-based reward, engagement in an activity, displaying a quality or qualification and so on. Digital badges are set under technical standards of Open Badges founded by Mozilla which are backed with meta-data that verifies its authenticity.

Digital credentials are shareable, portable and verifiable. Both digital certificates and digital badges save time and expenses that go into issuing physical certification and badges.
