# Benefits of the Digital Certification Programs

As a result of the global pandemic's rapid advancements in technology and remote learning experience, educational institutions and businesses across all industries have adapted to digital learning programmes to fill skill gaps or acquire knowledge of new learning skills.

Because knowledge and information can be accessed from any digital platform or online videos in today's digital world, recruiters and hiring managers must verify the legitimacy of the acquired competencies through documentation or the currently popular digital credentials.

Digital credentials are the virtual equivalent to the paper-based credential and come with blockchain technology that facilitates the issuing process and is secured with bank-level encryption.

## Benefits of the Digital Certification programs:

### Speeds up reskilling:

Learners can use digital certification programmes to learn or acquire knowledge of skills relevant to the modern workplace. Unlike traditional course programmes, which require the learner to devote an entire year and large sets of modules to complete the course, certification programmes have specialised courses for each skill that the learner can know and understand in three to six months.

### Professional Development:

Digitalisation has brought about some changes, such as the integration of technology, which has replaced labour, resulting in new skill demand. Certification programmes address this issue by recognising the learner's skills and preparing them to adapt to the new technologically advanced workplace. A digital credential obtained through such a training and certification programme contributes to professional development because it serves as proof of the competencies and skills acquired.

### Easy Verification:

Recruiters must verify the legitimacy of the skills and qualifications, as well as their relevance to the job role. The certification programme issues digital credentials that are backed up with metadata that stores the records and criteria of the credential into digital databases, making it easy for recruiters to verify and trace back to the origins of the credential acquired.

### Bank-level encryption:

Digital credentials issued by a reputable credential issuing platform are protected with bank-level encryption, which means the certification has the same level of security as a bank or financial document. To prevent unauthorised access, the digital credential can be encrypted with a digital passcode. These security methods protect the document from privacy violations, cyber threats, forgeries, and tampering as well.

### Allows Specialisation:

Unlike traditional courses that need to follow a course pattern, certification programs give scope for innovation, meaning, learners can acquire skills from any range of skill-set or relevancy without being obliged to follow certain criteria. Learners can enrol themselves in multiple courses accumulating credentials for career advancements as well as specialising in different aspects or areas of the subject matter.

### In Conclusion:

Learners benefit from certification programmes in a variety of ways since they are the safest and most efficient approach to get certifications and specialise in various fields of study. They're easy to share and can be validated thanks to the meta-data backing them up. In today's workplace, certification programmes can help with professional development and progress.
